Create a Java application that will request an input file from the user. The file can be of any type: word, mov, mp3, excel, ppt, etc. The function of the application is to be able to create a backup copy of the input file on the same directory of the input file. You have to put _bak after the filename before the extension.

Enter a filename: D:\books\SCJP Sun Certified Programmer.pdf
Successfully created backup file.
SCJP Sun Certified Programmer_bak.pdf on D:\books.
